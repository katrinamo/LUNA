Title: createAccount.html
Author: Dillon Pulliam
Date: 7/7/2017

Purpose: This code is for the html page behind the initial create account screen that is only accessed the very first time the user accesses the app. This page will ask 
the user to enter their random ID sent to their uky email to verify that they are a UK student. It will also ask the user to create a username and password which 
must be entered in to change any app settings. The app will send all this data to the server and the server will send back a uid to store within the local 
storage component of the app. Note that this page should only be accessed the very first time the user opens the app and is bypassed all other times.

Input:
    emailID: This is the random string sent to the user's UKY email address to verify they are a UK student.
    username: a random username created by the user. A hashed version is then sent to the server.
    password: a random password created by the user. A hashed version is then sent to the server.

Output:
    Success:
        New user added to the database and hashed username and password are stored.
        Success message sent to the app along with a uid.
        App is then linked back to onBoarding questions page.

    Failure:
        Failure message sent to the app. This could either be that the server didn't recieve the data or that the user failed to fill out a necessary field for
        data to be sent.
