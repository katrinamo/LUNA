<h1>Installing Luna on Windows OS</h1>
<p>Step 1: Downloaded the Microsoft Visual Studios Community. After
it has downloaded and installed you will then see multiple programs
within Visual Studios you may install. Select and install both the
basic visual studios editor (note: this will be installed
automatically!) as well as the &quot;Mobile App development
environment with Javascript&quot;. Install this by checking its box
and then selecting the install button at the bottom of the page. Note
that the Visual Studios Editor is free to UK CS students and can be
installed at the following link: <a href="https://www.cs.uky.edu/csportal">https://www.cs.uky.edu/csportal</a>.
Once logged on, click the MSDNAA link on the left. 
</p>
<p>Step 2: Download and install NodeJS. NodeJS can be installed at
the following link <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a>.
Choose version v6.11.0 LTS. This is the version that is recommended
for most users. 
</p>
<p>Step 3: Download and install &quot;GitBash&quot; or a similiar
termial. Having a terminal window similiar to a Linux environment is
crucial and GitBash appears to be recommended the most for Windows
users as the Windows OS doesn't readily/easily have a terminal
available as a MAC OS does. GitBash can be downloaded and installed
at the following link: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>.
After going to this site click on the Windows link and the
installation process should begin.</p>
<p>Step 4: Download and install Ionic by opening up a GitBash
terminal window and running the command &quot;npm install -g ionic
cordova&quot;. Note that if you are asked to update anything while in
the terminal while the installation process is going select &quot;yes&quot;.
This should install Ionic, the Ionic 2 framework, and Cordova which
will allow for the creation of applications. Run from the terminal
window: &quot;npm rebuild node-sass&quot;. This command is needed
when using an app built on Mac, on a Windows OS, to have the correct
version of nodeJS running.</p>
<p>Step 5: Install the Ionic templates to Visual Studios. Note that
the templates you have to install with Visual Studios 2017 is the
Ionic 2 Framework even though it is still in its Beta development
stages. In order to properly install the Ionic templates to Visual
Studios follow the process shown at the following link:
<a href="https://taco.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tutorial-ionic/">https://taco.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tutorial-ionic/</a></p>
<p>Step 6: Copy over the LunaShip.zip file that contains the
directory Luna_app (the app code). Then use the GitBash terminal and
the unzip command to unzip all the files. Note that you can't simply
extract all the files as this won't work creating paths that are too
long. Unzip the file by using the 'cd' Linux command to change
directories into where the zip file is stored. Then use the command
&quot;unzip LunaShip.zip&quot; to unzip the file. 
</p>
<p>Step 7. Open a GitBash terminal and use the 'cd' or change
directory command to step into your Luna_app folder that will be
created after unzipping LunaShip.zip. This folder contains all the
necessary files for the LUNA app to run. Then execute the &quot;ionic
serve&quot; command once in the correct directory to open up the LUNA
app and get it running. Note that while doing this you may recieve
some notifications to update/upgrade some of your environment
features. Say yes to all updates. The app will then open up correctly
in a browser.</p>
<p>Note: There is a way to open apps like Luna directly from Visual
Studios but so far I have been unable to do this as it involves
copying over 50 folders into an Ionic Visual Studios Project in order
to get all the dependencies correct. I am still working on a way to
do this easily.</p>
<p>However, by using the &quot;ionic serve&quot; command the Ionic
app opens up in a browser. You can then open up that app's specific
files/pages in an editor like Visual Studios and make changes to
them. After saving these files you will see the app update itself in
real time without having to reload it each time a change is made!</p>
<p>Note that in order to open the app up in lab mode and see how it
will look on different devices (iOS, Android, and Windows) instead of
executing the &quot;ionic serve&quot; command execute the &quot;ionic
serve -l&quot; command.</p>
