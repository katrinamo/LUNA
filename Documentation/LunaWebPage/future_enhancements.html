<H3 CLASS="western"><A HREF="appledeveloper.html">Apple Developer
Program</A> 
</H3>
<P>Developers need to have an Apple ID (free) to get Xcode for Luna
app testing. However, to make the Luna iOS app available in the Apple
store, the customer must enroll in the Apple Developer Enterprise
Program ($99/year).</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Android Version</H3>
<P>The Ionic development framework can be used to develop iOS and
Android apps. Due to time constraints, and lack of Android devices
for testing, we have only used it for iOS development and testing.
According to the Ionic documentation, it is a simple matter to create
an Android app, using the same code used for iOS development.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Remind User to Answer Daily Questions (and only
once per day)</H3>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A
reminder sent to the user by the app to answer the daily questions if
they have not yet been answered by the time the user specified to
answer them in the day. </FONT></FONT>
</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="_GoBack"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Only
allow the User to Respond to the Daily Questions Once per Day:
Currently a user can respond to the daily questions multiple times a
day and all responses will be stored in the server. In the future, a
user needs to be allowed to respond to the daily questions once per
day</FONT></FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Research Queries to the Data Base 
</H3>
<P>For the customer to use the information that users will supply,
and that will be put in the Luna Data base, queries will have to be
supplied that a person not experienced in data base operation and SQL
queries can use.</P>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Calendar
	Enhancements: Add in the event markers to the calendar to signal the
	beginning and end of a user’s cycle. Will then need to add a
	legend to the calendar to show which symbols/colors represent what
	on the calendar. Additionally, the calendar page could also give
	some type of countdown that lists the number of days until the next
	cycle.</FONT></FONT></P>

		<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Update
		the Last Period in the Settings Page: In the settings page, the
		last period date is an output. Once the app is operational this
		needs to be determined by a user’s response to the “Are you on
		your period” daily question. Currently the app will output the
		original response to this onboarding questions forever and there is
		no way for the user to change their response manually since this
		needs to be determined by the app itself.</FONT></FONT></P>
		<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Update
		the Cycle Length in the Settings Page: In the settings page, the
		cycle length is an output. Once the app is operational this needs
		to be determined by a user’s responses to the “Are you on your
		period” daily question. Currently the app will output the
		original response to this onboarding questions forever and there is
		no way for the user to change their response manually since this
		needs to be determined by the app itself. Additionally, the app
		could also compare the user’s original cycle length (what they
		originally entered when inputting their responses to the daily
		questions) to the cycle length the app has determined a user has. </FONT></FONT>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Progress
	Tracker for the Tracker Page: Make a way for the user to view their
	past responses to the daily questions. This would allow the user to
	see how their responses are changing over time. Note that this
	feature would probably require a login page like what is currently
	used for the settings page due to security reasons.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Link
	the Luna App and Sara App: Allow Luna and Sara to communicate with
	one another. For example, if a user submits a sexual assault through
	Sara then they should get an update in Luna saying they submitted a
	sexual assault. This feature would need to be password protected
	only allowing the user themselves to see the report alert. The user
	would therefore need to be asked to sign in again.</FONT></FONT></P>

<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">Error Log and Support
Notification</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Log
errors that can’t be fixed by a user in a server error log table so
that a support person can work to resolve these issues. Send email to
a customer account to notify the support person.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Password/username changes</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Password/Username
Changes: Currently if a user forgets their password or username then
they can delete the app off their phone and re-download the app. If
they remember their random email ID then they could just re-log into
the app and their old data would still be stored in the server.
However, if the user does not remember their random email ID string
then they would lose their account when downloading a new app. In the
future, there needs to be some link for a user to select on the
settings page if they forget either their username or password with a
way to update them. However, since the user’s email account is not
stored within the database we would probably have to ask the user to
input their email again so they can be sent a new form allowing them
to update their username and password.</FONT></FONT></P>
