<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
past semester the amount of things we learned really is innumerable.
Here is a brief list of just some of the things we learned:</FONT></FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Ionic
	Framework: </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
	learned how to work with the Ionic Framework, particularly Ionic
	version 2. Ionic was at the core of app creation with its built-in
	dependencies and commands that made it simple to add features into
	our app.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Xcode:</B></FONT></FONT>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To do the final
	build of the app and transport it to a mobile device like an iPhone
	or an iPad Xcode was used. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>NodeJS:</B></FONT></FONT>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>NodeJS was used
	within the app for server communication and the HTTP protocols. By
	incorporating this feature into our app, we allowed it to
	communicate with our server and database.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Databases:</B></FONT></FONT>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To have a working
	project one of our major project constraints was to have a working
	database that could receive and store the user info sent from the
	app. Throughout the semester we built a database using webhost that
	works in sync with our Luna app. Our customer will have access to
	this database which is needed for research purposes.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>App
	Making:</B></FONT></FONT> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
	learned about app making in general. We learned that Ionic can be
	used to make apps for iOS, Android, and Windows operating systems.
	We learned that apps are typically made with a combination of
	Typescript, HTML, and Sass code for Ionic (in Xcode an app can be
	made directly for an iOS device typically using just use the Swift
	language)</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Security:</B></FONT></FONT>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since we were
	sending sensitive information back and forth between the app and the
	server and storing it we learned about the Md5 protocol and hashing
	(one-way encryption). Security was achieved by storing both the
	username and the password in a hashed version server side and
	sending a random user ID to the app. This user ID was then stored it
	in local storage to identify app users when sending data to the
	server.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Local
	Storage:</B></FONT></FONT> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
	learned about app local storage and how it could be used to hold app
	info within the user’s mobile device. Using local storage allowed
	us to bypass the login page except for initial login, making
	usability much simpler. We also learned that by using local storage
	we could use fewer server calls to the database since some info
	could be stored directly on the device in the app making the overall
	project design much simpler.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Network
	Communication:</B></FONT></FONT> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
	learned about the HTTP protocol and how data can be sent over a
	network to a server. This was an essential feature of our app since
	we wanted user info to be stored in the server so the customer could
	access essential research data.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Product
	Development:</B></FONT></FONT> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
	class was set up to similar to a how a product design team would
	operate at a major corporation. We learned much about product
	development as we had weekly meetings with our customer and also met
	twice weekly (sometimes more) as a group to discuss product details,
	implementations, and potential challenges.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Testing:</B></FONT></FONT>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We learned the
	importance of creating an efficient and well documented testing plan
	that is easy to follow. By creating a complete testing plan, it not
	only made it easy to test the app but will also make it easier for
	future groups that may access or modify our product.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Documentation:</B></FONT></FONT>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We learned the
	importance of proper documentation and how it is necessary for any
	major project like the one we undertook. Over the last two weeks of
	the semester we have primarily been concerned with documenting
	everything in our app. We have documented our source code, testing
	procedure, user scenarios, installation, etc. This will help any
	future developers who may view our designs and make modifications to
	the app and database. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Teamwork:</B></FONT></FONT>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We learned the
	importance of teamwork and communication when working on any major
	project with more than one team member. To stay up to date on our
	latest project developments it was essential to use email to
	communicate between team members and let them know what was going
	on. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
you can see, throughout the semester we learned how to work with a
wide variety of technologies and how to incorporate them all into one
final working project. It seemed like every week we were faced with a
new challenge that could potentially derail our entire project.
However, through perseverance our group always managed to find a
solution, implement it into the design, and solve the problem before
tackling the next obstacle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although
we couldn’t meet all customer requirements for the app, we have
created a very solid groundwork that a future team will be able to
use to finish the Luna project. We have virtually all essential
features of the app incorporated except for the Calendar component,
and the database is functioning properly to record user data. Our
design and documentation make it easy to determine how the Luna
product functions.</FONT></FONT></P>
